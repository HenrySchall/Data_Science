> Python is a programming language created by Guido van Rossum, a Dutch programmer, in 1991. Guido van Rossum created the language with the goal of developing simple, intuitive and easy-to-learn programming, without sacrificing the ability to solve complex problems. The name "Python" was inspired by the British comedy group "Monty Python", of which van Rossum was a fan.
